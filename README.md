timer logic pseudo code:

if timer hasn't started, display "Start Break" if break timer is initiated, otherwise display "Start Focus" on button.

if (timerMinute is counting down && break is true) {

}

if timer is started, remove "Start Focus" or "Start Break" text from button and start animation.

if timer is paused, pause animation.
